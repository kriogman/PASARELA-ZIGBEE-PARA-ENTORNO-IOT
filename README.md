# PASARELA-ZIGBEE-PARA-ENTORNO-IOT

This project proposes the design of an architecture to create a Zigbee gateway for an IoT environment. The proposed design is intended to be flexible and to be able to adapt the infrastructure to meet specific requirements for a home automation network.

The project is based on the Zigbee wireless protocol to create a network of sensors and actuators. This protocol is based on the IEEE 802.15.4 standard developed to create battery-operated devices that require low power consumption. In addition to Zigbee, different types of technologies and tools are used that are widely used today for the development of projects related to smart devices.

We maintain the development framework of this project in the context of a network of sensors and actuators that use Zigbee as a communication protocol. For this network, we need to obtain and process the reading data from these sensors and the commands sent to the actuator devices. The objective of this project is the design and development of an architecture with a gateway for a Zigbee network. The architecture allows this network to be accessible through the Internet and different dashboards are developed for the monitoring and control of the home automation network.

Relying on different communication protocols, hardware and software, we create an IoT environment where we are able to define and control the logic of the operation and interaction of the different IoT devices.
